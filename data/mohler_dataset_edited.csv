1.1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.,High risk problems are address in the prototype program to make sure that the program is feasible.  A prototype may also be used to show a company that the software can be possibly programmed.,4,3,3.5
1.2,What stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?,The testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7),Refining and possibly the design if the testing phase reveals problems in the design. Production can be affected if the program is unworkable in its current form which will lead to a later production time than originally estimated. Also affects coding because after testing you may need to rewrite the code for the program to remove errors.,5,2,3.5
1.3,What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,Abstraction and reusability.,"Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.",4,5,4.5
1.4,Where do C++ programs begin to execute?,At the main function.,At function ‘int main ()’,5,5,5
1.5,What is a variable?,A location in memory that can store a value.,Variable can be a integer or a string in a program.,1,3,2
1.6,Where are variables declared in a C++ program?,Variables can be declared anywhere in a program. They can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables),"They can be declared right before they are used, but it is a good practice to declare them at the beginning of the program and label what they are food.",1,3,2
1.7,What is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?,The block inside a do...while statement will execute at least once.,"""The “do” statement first evaluates the condition and then executes the lines of code in the statement 0 or more times. 	The “do while” statement executes the lines of code and then it evaluates the condition. """,4,5,4.5
2.1,What is typically included in a class definition?,Data members (attributes) and member functions.,"For us it is usually a set, get, and displayMessge or other messages that tell you what properties a class has but does not reveal its implementations. You could have anything you want in your own class definition.",1,3,2
2.2,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,Data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. Local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.,Data members are the data components of a particular class.  A member function are the functioning components of the class.,1,5,3
2.3,What is the difference between a constructor and a function?,"A constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. Constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type.",A constructor initializes an object or objects of a class.  A function of a class performs a task such as display a line of text or do some kind of mathematical operations.,2,3,2.5
2.4,When does C++ create a default constructor?,"If no constructor is provided, the compiler provides one by default. If a constructor is defined for a class, the compiler does not create a default constructor.",The compiler creates a default constructor when we do not define one in our class file,5,5,5
2.5,How many constructors can be created for a class?,Unlimited number.,Just one per class.,0,0,0
2.6,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,"A function prototype includes the function signature, i.e., the name of the function, the return type, and the parameters' type. The function definition includes the actual body of the function.",A function definition does not require any additional information that needs to be passed inside its parenthesis  to execute. While a definition prototype requires more than one parameters to be passed in order to complete its  task.,5,3,4
2.7,What is the role of a header-file?,"To store a class interface, including data members and member function prototypes.",the role of a header file list all the functions a class can do while hiding the inner workings of its functions,5,4,4.5
3.1,What does a function signature include?,The name of the function and the types of the parameters.,"It includes the name of the program, the type of parameters it can take. It should also include a brief description of what the function does.",4,5,4.5
3.2,What is the scope of global variables?,File scope.,Any functions that follows their deceleration that  are in the source code file are allowed to have access the variables.  Also global scope variables retrain their value throughout the execution of the program.,5,5,5
3.3,How does the compiler handle inline functions?,It makes a copy of the function code in every place where a function call is made.,It expands the function's definition in that place.  Once the functions is called you can use it as many times as you need.  The compiler just expands on the function.,4,5,4.5
3.4,What is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference?,It avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.,Overall the program has better performance (means it is faster) because it does not have to copy large amounts of data.,5,5,5
3.5,How are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?,"Based on the function signature. When an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call.",overloaded function simply invovles haing a method with the same name within the class. is used to implement a method for subclass which overrides in other words replaces the implementation of the super class. Overloading the concept of providing different meaning to a object based on the context of its presence. Overloading is one type of polymorphism and this is also a feature in programing.,1,5,3
3.6,"When defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?","If the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included.",recursion refers to situations in which functions call themselves. These types of functions are known as recursive functions. That being said Infinite recursion occurs when the function is designed in such a way as to call it self forever without stopping possible causes,1,5,3
3.7,What are the similarities between iteration and recursion?,They both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.,"they both are able to do repetiive tasks. however recurisve calls itself with different parameters and defines and exit clause that is guaranteeed to be reached. Iterative includes a loop which iterates a pre-determined number of times, or checks for an exit clause every time through",2,5,3.5
4.1,What are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?,"In the array declaration, or by using an initializer list.","use an arraylist, or have your program ask the array how many elements it has. As an obj it it should have member length that is the number of slots it has. ",3,5,4
4.2,What is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?,The strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.,"the type string is a class and is safer, while the other is just an array of characters.",3,4,3.5
4.2,What is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?,The strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.,"array  it is the collection of similar data types ex:int a[10]  ten indicates the size of array. [ ] is index of array, we can give only integer values to array of a.  where as string mean collection of group of characters.  string declarations have a datatype usually causes storage to be allocated in memory that is capable of holding some predetermined number of symbols.    However  Arrays can be declared to contain values of any non reference data type. Multiple arrarys of the same type ",1,4,2.5
4.3,How are arrays passed to functions?,by reference.,"The function reads the variables, stores them. then returns the what ever the variable reads. The function then prints the content of the array. ",1,4,2.5
4.4,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?","The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called.","if they are declared fixed or static that means they can't change size once their storage has been allocated, however one that is not or dynamic arrarys can be resized.   ",1,5,3
4.5,How many dimensions need to be specified when passing a multi-dimensional array as an argument to a function?,"All the dimensions, except the first one.","Multi dimensional arrays are accessed using more than 1  index, one for each dimension at least. ",2,5,3.5

5.4,What is the base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort?,When the size of the array to be sorted is 1 (or 2),O(n log n),1,3,2
6.1,What is a pointer?,A variable that contains the address in memory of another variable.,A pointer is a way to get at another object. Essentially it is a way to grab an instance of an object and then either pass that instance a message or retreive some data from that object. A pointer is actually just an address of where an instance is held in memory.,4,5,4.5
6.2,What does the address (&) operator return?,The memory address of its operand.,returns a pointer,4,3,3.5
6.3,What does the star (*) operator return?,An alias (synonym) for the name of the object that its operand points to in memory. It is the dereferencing operator.,will return zero or many characters placed before the operator,1,3,2

Use of dot or pointer operators within the receiving function and use of '&' operator inside the passing function",2,3,2.5
6.7,What is a function pointer?,The address of the location in memory where the function code resides.,"When dereferenced, a function pointer invokes a function, passing it zero or more arguments just like a normal function. In programming languages like C, function pointers can be used to simplify code, such as replacing large switch statements.",4,4,4
7.1,What is a linked list?,A collection of elements that can be allocated dynamically.,"A linked list is one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures.

7.2,What is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?,The linked lists can be of variable length.,The size of array is restricted to declaration. Insertion/Deletion of values in middle of array is not possible.,5,5,5
7.3,What is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?,"The elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal).","Array size is fixed. But Linked is not fixed, data is also accessed quicker in array list, also memory requirement is less and no pointers required. Arrays have random access and less overheads compared to Linked list have sequential access only with too much overheads and no cache memory support. On the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. Singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction.",5,5,5
7.4,How are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?,By reference.,"Linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time,[1] but do not allow random access. ",0,3,1.5
7.5,What is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?,The last element in a circular linked list points to the head of the list.,"In the case of a non circular link list, if you are at the last node of the list and u want to move to first u need to go to one, step back till u reach to first. But in circular link list from last to first you need to make only one move.  In a single link list u can move only in one direction but in double link list u can move in any direction back or forward or forward.  ",2,5,3.5
7.6,What is the main advantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?,"All the deletion and insertion operations can be performed in constant time, including those operations performed before a given location in the list or at the end of the list.","The primary disadvantage of doubly linked lists are that (1) each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space, and (2) the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer (more pointer operations).",0,4,2
7.7,What is the main disadvantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?,Extra space required to store the back pointers.,not answered,0,0,0
8.1,What is a stack?,"A data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the first to be removed (or last-in-first-out)","Stacks are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from the end of the container.",5,5,5

8.3,How can you implement a stack with an array?,"Keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array.","Stack usually holds a bunch of items with the same type, therefore u can use an array, to hold the content of the stack and an integer top that holds the index of the element at the top of the stack. u Choose an array size. Then the sequence of operations used. u have to decide what data types are needed for this stack data structure. ",2,4,3
8.4,How can you implement a stack with a list?,"Keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list.","Using a linked list is one way to implement a stack so that it can handle essentially any number of elements. It is usually convenient to put a data structure in its own module, thus, you'll want to create files stack.h and a stack.c",0,4,2

8.6,How are infix expressions evaluated by computers?,"First, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression.","Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations. ",5,5,5
